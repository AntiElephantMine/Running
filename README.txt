[ABOUT]

I am teaching myself C++ from the great book C++ Primer 5th Edition. As I learn more and complete each chapter I try to practically apply what I have learned to my programs, if at all possible.


This is a simple console based program for joggers which can do a few things:

1) Ask user for data on a jog and present race information back, asking the user whether he'd like to do further calculations or store the record for later display.
2) Display saved jog data, in the provided units (miles or kilometers) and possibly in a specified order (speed, distance or time).
3) Continuous record mode to easily input records, from user or another file, in to a saved file.
4) Backup data to a saved location.



[TO USE]

Clicking on the .exe will provide mode (1) from above, however opening up the executable in the console with additional options can provide other modes (opening with the additional option "-h" will provide help on how to access these other modes). 

You will have to compile your own version with the provided files, as the provided .exe has hard-wired file locations to my Hard Drive.

All that needs to be done is to change "recordfile" and "backupfile" in "Record.cpp" to appropriate locations for your use.




[FUTURE AIMS]

As I learn more C++ I hope to develop this program further. Once I have learned how to, I will:

1) Move out of the console and in to a more appealing display format.
2) Allow interactive selecting and editing of current records.
3) Hmm.....

Any programming advice is welcome :)
